# Human in the Loop and Flatland

# Problem
Assuming that Flatland exists with an AI-supported scheduling agent, we began to lay the foundation for the question of how we can make the Flatland data more accessible to people and how people can communicate with the AI-supported scheduling agent so that it knows the optimization goals, or people can integrate with the AI. The interaction should be possible globally, or at the agent level. This means that on the one hand we want to communicate the global goals to the system or adapt them dynamically, but we also want to give each agent a strategy that differs from the global one. This means that different goals can be pursued at different levels or, depending on the importance of a move, which goals or priorities it should pursue.

We were particularly concerned with the question of how the information from Flatland can be made accessible to people so that they can get an overview very quickly and easily. In addition, we tried to create a first version in the first draft that would reduce the cognitive load on people. We were also inspired by the idea of ​​hypervision.

We also thought about how everything could be arranged. On the one hand, the system should make suggestions to the user as possible scenarios and, on the other hand, the user should be able to arrange a single move directly.
For this purpose, we built a UI prototype that visually represents the essential elements and explains the different views.
