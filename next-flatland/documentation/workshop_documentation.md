# Next Flatland

## Core Idea
The main idea was developed at the Flatland Workshop 2023. It has been written down initially by Christian Eichenberger here: [Concept](../documentation/core_concept.md)

## Discussion Workshop
During the 2024 workshop the Team:
- Merlin
- Thomas
- Florian
- Erik

Worked on a simple prototype to test the concept in code.
