# Next Graph-Based Observation

## Objectives

1. âœ… Verify tree obs is collapsed (not intermedate cells)
2. ðŸ”² Re-create - integrate Alberto's solution into Flatland core
3. ðŸ”² What feature can we add to augment the information to conflict in Alberto's solution?

## Tree Obs

Current implementation is cell based.
However, there is a collapsed implementation [here](https://github.com/aiAdrian/flatland_railway_extension?tab=readme-ov-file).

## Alberto's approach

* will be open-sourced in the next few weeks. However, it's [maze](https://github.com/enlite-ai/maze)-based, not generic Flatland observation.
* pruned tree in-memory, list of features:

Class for storing the node features

Each node information is composed of 14 features.


Missing/padding nodes are filled in with -inf (truncated).
Missing values in present node are filled in with +inf (truncated).

## Ideation of additional features

* n-shortest: weighted
  ![nShortest.png](nShortest.png)
* further ideas?

## Next steps

* Training environment to test out improvements? In Flatland or de-centralized?
* Read up Tree-LSTM paper
* Read up https://github.com/enlite-ai/maze
* Implementation probably makes sense on top of graph-based core instead of grid to graph conversion to actions on grid
