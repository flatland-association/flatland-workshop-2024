# Next Graph-Based Observation

## Objectives

1. âœ… Verify tree obs is collapsed (not intermedate cells)
2. ðŸ”² Re-create - integrate Alberto's solution into Flatland core
3. ðŸ”² What feature can we add to augment the information to conflict in Alberto's solution?

## Tree Obs

Current implementation is cell based.
However, there is a collapsed implementation [here](https://github.com/aiAdrian/flatland_railway_extension?tab=readme-ov-file).

## Alberto's approach

* will be open-sourced in the next few weeks. However, it's [maze](https://github.com/enlite-ai/maze)-based, not generic Flatland observation.
* pruned tree in-memory, list of features:

Class for storing the node features

Each node information is composed of 14 features.

## Efficient Implementation?

The exploration is time-consuming.
Alberto reaches branch-depth max 3 to stay within submission limit. Corresponds to "cell-depth" of 10-25.
![Collapse dGraph](CollapsedGraph.png)

For Alberto's MCTS, TreeObs is the bigger bottleneck than serialization/de-serialization of intermediate states.

:warning: However, from a AI4RealNet Project Perspective, serialization/de-serialization has highest priority.

## Ideation of additional features

* n-shortest: weighted
  ![nShortest.png](nShortest.png)
* further ideas?

## Next steps

* Training environment to test out improvements? In Flatland or de-centralized? -> XGBoost compoare with trajectories from early training sortish.
* Read up Tree-LSTM paper
* Read up https://github.com/enlite-ai/maze
* Implementation probably makes sense on top of graph-based core instead of grid to graph conversion to actions on grid -> could already be usable right now as
  a "baseline", from that point of view maybe start early, Alberto not blocked, question of priorities... Open:
    * look up shortest paths in current implementation
    * use Adrian's graph for shortest path computations in the core as well?
    *

## Tangible Outcomes

* [Description (issue)](https://github.com/flatland-association/flatland-rl/issues/89)
  and [draft pr](https://github.com/flatland-association/flatland-rl/pull/90) of implementation in Flatland 3
* [Description (issue) of episodes for performance benchmarking](https://github.com/flatland-association/flatland-rl/issues/92)
* Take up Flatland dev coffee group (2 weekly) again
    * Slack for instant messaging
    * GitHub discussions
